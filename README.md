# Task--4-SQL-Analysis
This project uses the Superstore dataset to practice and demonstrate SQL for data analysis. The dataset contains sales, profit, customer, and regional data for a fictional retail company. Using SQL queries, we explore business insights such as top-performing categories, sales trends, and regional performance.
# ðŸ›’ Superstore Dataset - SQL for Data Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project demonstrates how to use *SQL* for data analysis with the popular *Superstore dataset*.  
The dataset contains details about sales, profits, customers, shipping, and regions for a fictional retail store.  
By writing SQL queries, we uncover valuable business insights and answer analytical questions.

## âš™ Tools & Technologies
- *SQL* (MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQLite â€“ depending on your setup)  
- Dataset: Superstore (CSV/Excel format)

## ðŸš€ How to Use
1. Import the Superstore dataset into your SQL database.  
   - Example (MySQL):
     sql
     LOAD DATA INFILE 'superstore.csv'
     INTO TABLE superstore
     FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
     IGNORE 1 ROWS;
     
2. Run the SQL queries provided in the scripts folder (queries.sql).  
3. Modify queries as needed to explore additional insights.

## ðŸ“Š Example Query
```sql
-- Find total sales and profit by region
SELECT 
    Region, 
    ROUND(SUM(Sales),2) AS Total_Sales, 
    ROUND(SUM(Profit),2) AS Total_Profit
FROM superstore
GROUP BY Region
ORDER BY Total_Profit DESC;
